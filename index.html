          Frank is a fast learner and quickly grasps key concepts of anything that is asked of him.

          He has a inquisitive mind and asks the right questions no matter how simple they may seem. 
          He takes initiative within a team and has potentials to lead the team to any goal even if it may seem difficult.

          Working with Frank has been an awesome experience and I learned so much from him. 
          He is incredibly knowledgeable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right even if he has to work twice as hard. 
          For any future projects that need his expertise and extreme focus,I would definitely want to work with him again.

          I had worked along with Frank during the initial phase of our venture which needed electrical design and programming of micro controllers. 
          He is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain and when he doesn't he will go out of his way to find the answer. 
          He will be an asset for any organization or project!
